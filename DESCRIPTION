Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Yusman", "Kamaleri", email = "ybkamaleri@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Create a pie like plot to visualise if the aim or several aims of a
             project is achieved or close to be achieved i.e the aim is achieved when the point is at the
             center of the pie plot. Imagine it's like a dartboard and the center means 100%
             completeness/achievement. Achievement can also be understood as 100%
             coverage. The standard distribution of completeness allocated in the pie plot
             is 50%, 80% and 100% completeness.
