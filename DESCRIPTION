Description: Create a pie like plot to visualise if the aim or several aims of a
             project is achieved or close to be achieved i.e when the point is at the
             center of a pie. Imagine it's like a dartboard and the center means 100%
             completeness/achievement. Achievement can also be understood as 100%
             coverage. The standard distribution of completeness allocated in the pie
             is 50%, 80% and 100% completeness
