## Create a Pie Like Plot of Completeness

Create a pie like plot to visualise if the aim or several aims of a project is achieved or close to be achieved i.e the aim is achieved when the point is at the center of the pie plot. Imagine it's like a dartboard and the center means 100% completeness/achievement. Achievement can also be understood as 100% coverage. The standard distribution of completeness allocated in the pie plot is 50%, 80% and 100% completeness.
